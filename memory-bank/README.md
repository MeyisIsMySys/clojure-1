## 🎯 Learning Path

### Beginner (Weeks 1-4)
1. **Fundamentals** - Basic syntax, REPL usage, data types
2. **Data structures** - Lists, vectors, maps, sets - the heart of Clojure
3. **Functions** - Functions as first-class citizens, higher-order functions
4. **Flow control** - Conditionals, loops, iteration patterns

### Intermediate (Weeks 5-8)
5. **Namespaces** - Code organization and module system
6. **Java interoperability** - Leveraging the JVM ecosystem
7. **Testing** - Writing tests with clojure.test

### Advanced (Weeks 9-12)
8. **Macros** - Metaprogramming and code transformation
9. **Concurrency** - Atoms, refs, agents, futures
10. **Web development** - Building web applications with Ring/Compojure

### Mastery (Ongoing)
11. **Practice regularly** - Exercises and real-world projects
12. **Contribute to open source** - Apply your skills

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Install Clojure: https://clojure.org/guides/install_clojure
2. Set up your development environment
3. Start with `01-fundamentals/01-getting-started.clj`
4. Work through each section progressively
5. Practice with exercises in `99-exercises/`
