| 11 | **09-web-development** | Full-stack development | Web applications, APIs |
| 12 | **Capstone Project** | Real-world application | Integration of all concepts |

### 🎯 Phase 4: Mastery (Ongoing)
**Goal: Practical application and specialization**

- **99-exercises/** - Continuous skill refinement
- **99-projects/** - Portfolio development
- **Open Source** - Community contribution
- **Specialization** - Choose your domain (web, data, etc.)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Environment Setup** - Run `../setup.sh` for automated tool installation
- **Code Editor** - VS Code recommended (included in setup)
- **Mindset** - Embrace interactive, REPL-driven development

### Your First Learning Session

1. **Environment Check**
   ```bash
   # Verify setup
   mise run test-setup
   
   # Start interactive REPL
   mise run repl
   ```

2. **Begin with Fundamentals**
   - Open `01-fundamentals/01-getting-started.clj`
   - Read the comments and examples
   - Copy code into REPL and experiment
   - Modify examples to understand behavior

3. **REPL-Driven Learning Workflow**
   ```clojure
   ;; Load namespace
   (require '[memory-bank.fundamentals.getting-started] :reload)
   
   ;; Experiment with examples
   (+ 1 2 3)
   
   ;; Try variations
   (+ 1 2 3 4 5)
   ```

4. **Track Your Progress**
   - Use `../my-learning-journey.md` to log insights
   - Complete exercises in each module
   - Build mini-projects to apply concepts

### 🎯 Daily Learning Routine

**20 minutes minimum, 1 hour optimal:**

1. **Review (5 min)** - Previous day's concepts
2. **New Material (30 min)** - Current module content  
3. **Practice (20 min)** - REPL experimentation
4. **Apply (5 min)** - Update learning journal

### 📖 How to Use Each Module

Each `.clj` file follows this structure:

```clojure
;; Module introduction and memory notes
;; Section 1: Basic concepts with examples
;; Section 2: Advanced patterns
;; Section 3: Real-world applications  
;; Section 4: Memory tips and gotchas
;; Section 5: Next steps and practice exercises
```

**Reading Strategy:**
1. Read all comments first for overview
2. Execute each code example in REPL
3. Experiment with variations
4. Complete suggested exercises
5. Move to next section when comfortable
