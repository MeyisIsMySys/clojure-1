# Conventional Commits Guide for Clojure Learning Memory Bank

This project follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification to maintain a clean and meaningful commit history that helps with automated changelog generation and semantic versioning.

## üìù Commit Message Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Examples
```
feat(fundamentals): add advanced REPL commands section
fix(data-structures): correct vector indexing example
docs(readme): update installation instructions

```

## üè∑Ô∏è Commit Types

### Primary Types (Most Common)

- `workspace` - VS Code workspace configuration

## üìã Writing Guidelines

### Description (Required)
- Use imperative mood: "add" not "added" or "adds"
- Start with lowercase letter
- No period at the end
- Maximum 50 characters
- Be specific and descriptive

**Good Examples:**
```
feat(fundamentals): add REPL debugging techniques
fix(data-structures): correct map destructuring syntax
docs(readme): clarify setup instructions for Windows
```

**Bad Examples:**
```
Added some stuff                    # Too vague
Fix.                               # Not descriptive
feat(fundamentals): Added new content about REPL debugging techniques that will help users learn. # Too long
```

### Body (Optional)
- Separate from description with blank line
- Wrap at 72 characters
- Explain what and why, not how
- Can include multiple paragraphs

```
feat(macros): add macro hygiene examples

Macro hygiene is a common stumbling block for intermediate learners.
These examples demonstrate:
- Symbol capture problems
- Solutions using gensym
- Best practices for macro writing

Addresses issue #42 about macro learning curve.
```

### Footer (Optional)
- Reference issues, breaking changes, or co-authors
- Format: `key: value` or `key #value`

```
feat(data-structures): add transducer examples

BREAKING CHANGE: removed deprecated sequence examples
Fixes #123
Co-authored-by: Jane Doe <jane@example.com>
```

## üîß Memory Bank Specific Patterns

### Adding New Learning Content
```
feat(topic): add [specific-concept] tutorial
feat(topic): add [concept] examples and exercises
feat(exercises): add [difficulty-level] problems for [topic]
feat(projects): add [project-type] project template
```

### Improving Existing Content
```
fix(topic): correct [specific-error] in [file-name]
refactor(topic): improve [concept] explanation clarity
style(topic): enhance code formatting and comments
docs(topic): add cross-references to related concepts
```

### Maintenance and Setup
```
chore(setup): update Clojure version to [version]
docs(contributing): add [specific-guideline]
build: configure [tool-name] for [purpose]
```

## üöÄ Examples for Common Scenarios

### Adding New Tutorial Content
```bash
git commit -m "feat(functions): add higher-order functions tutorial

Covers map, filter, reduce with practical examples.
Includes exercises progressing from basic to advanced.
Cross-references data-structures section."
```

### Fixing Code Examples
```bash
git commit -m "fix(data-structures): correct vector conj example

Previous example showed incorrect behavior for vector conj.
Updated to demonstrate proper vector appending."
```

### Updating Documentation
```bash
git commit -m "docs(readme): add troubleshooting section

Common issues with REPL setup and solutions.
Includes platform-specific guidance."
```

### Reorganizing Content
```bash
git commit -m "refactor(exercises): group problems by difficulty

Separates beginner, intermediate, and advanced exercises.
Improves learning progression and navigation."
```

### Adding Project Templates
```bash
git commit -m "feat(projects): add web scraper project template

Complete Ring/Compojure web scraping project.
Includes setup, dependencies, and step-by-step guide.
Suitable for intermediate learners."
```

## üîç Tools and Automation

### Commit Message Validation
Consider using these tools to enforce conventional commits:

1. **commitizen** - Interactive commit message helper
2. **conventional-changelog** - Generate changelogs automatically
3. **semantic-release** - Automated versioning and releases

### Git Hooks
Set up a commit-msg hook to validate format:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# .git/hooks/commit-msg
conventional_commit_regex='^(feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|test|chore|perf|build|ci|revert)(\(.+\))?: .{1,50}'

if ! grep -qE "$conventional_commit_regex" "$1"; then
    echo "Invalid commit message format!"
    echo "Please use: type(scope): description"
    echo "See .github/CONVENTIONAL_COMMITS.md for guidelines"
    exit 1
fi
```
