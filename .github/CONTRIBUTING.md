;; Title - Brief Description
;; Explanation of what this file covers

;; 1. SECTION TITLE
;; Explanation of the section

;; Code example with comments
(defn example-function
  "Documentation string explaining the function"
  [parameter]
  (do-something parameter))  ; Inline comment

;; 2. NEXT SECTION
;; Continue with logical progression

;; Memory tips or important notes
;; - Key point 1
